Intelligence garbage classification using deep learning
.
.
Introduction:
The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent garbage classification system using deep 
learning techniques. The system will utilize computer vision and deep neural networks to accurately 
classify different types of garbage items, such as plastic, paper, metal, and organic waste. By 
automating the classification process, the project aims to improve waste management practices, 
promote recycling, and reduce environmental pollution.
